In this project I created a Data Base system for a car rental company named "EVOL"(Electric Vehicles Online). I included an Interface as well. I created the Interface by using JavaSwing. I created the Database with MySQl. In this project, a client can rent a vehicle in EVOL company. First of all every client should sign up in the company. When a client signs up, then his/her data are inserted in the Database. Then, the client can log in and check for the available vehicles to rent. He can add insurance in the vehicle as well. I have some options for the cases that a car has collide, or any other problem.
